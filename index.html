        <h1>Our Goal</h1>
        <h2>What is Networking?</h2>
        <p>A network includes a group of people who cooperate with each other. 
          This implies people working closely together and with some crossover or connection in their purpose.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>
          Networking is about recognising and taking 
          advantage of valuable relationships to get things done and to achieve a goal.
        </br></br>
          It also involves working closely with other workers to be aware of potential and future needs or problems and devising strategies to address them.
        </br></br>
          Networking is also related to participation. Through the process of participation in issues in the workplace (people in the workplace joining together to discuss concerns and have a say in developing solutions), relationships and networks are established between people and workers in the organisation (or even in the community if your organisation provides services to the community). Networks potentially build a sense of common destiny and support. Thus, they help to empower individuals and strengthen the work team and the organisation itself.

        <h2>How can it benefit future leaders in Kosovo?</h2>
        <p>
          Encouraging the youth to work together, share their ideas, and learn from each other, is a step ahead for Kosovo towards a better future. Having creative minds get together and work with each other can have many impacts — it can lead to a startup which will benefit people and the economy.

          <h2>
            We believe there are many entrepreneurs in Kosovo who have not got the chance to share their ideas with like-minded people and achieve greatness, so we are here to change that!
